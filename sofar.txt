1. Key Decisions
Technology Stack: Proceeded with React Native (v0.74) using the Expo framework for the frontend, as specified.
Development Order: Prioritized installing core dependencies (redux, mmkv, firebase, stripe, etc.) before setting up the navigation structure.
Navigation: Implemented navigation using expo-router, creating layouts and placeholder screens for major flows (Tabs, Onboarding, Wizard, Editor, Settings).
Initial Screen Implementation: Started UI development with the Onboarding screen (onboarding.tsx), including a basic structure for the initial view and the subsequent Date of Birth (DOB) parental gate, based on the wireframes.
Entry Point Configuration: Corrected the default Expo project entry point (index.js / App.js) to use expo-router/entry in package.json for proper Expo Router integration.
Connectivity Troubleshooting: Switched to using Expo Tunnel (--tunnel) for the development server connection to address issues likely related to WSL networking and Expo Go connectivity.
Tunnel Dependency: Manually installed @expo/ngrok globally using sudo when the automatic installation failed, enabling the tunnel connection.
2. Action Items
Verify App Connection & Display (Owner: User, Due: Now): Confirm if the app now successfully connects and displays the basic Onboarding screen via Expo Go using the latest QR code generated with the --tunnel option.
Implement Redux Store & Provider (Owner: AI, Due: Next Steps): Set up the Redux Toolkit store and wrap the root layout (app/_layout.tsx) with the Redux Provider.
Implement Onboarding Logic (Owner: AI, Due: TBD - During Onboarding Dev):
Replace placeholder DOB input with a proper Date Picker component.
Implement actual DOB validation logic (COPPA compliance).
Implement navigation to sign-in/sign-up flows or the main app after successful onboarding/DOB verification.
Implement the actual Carousel UI on the initial onboarding view.
Configure Firebase (Owner: AI, Due: TBD - Before Auth/Backend Interaction): Set up Firebase configuration within the app.
Configure MMKV Storage (Owner: AI, Due: TBD - When needed for persistence): Integrate MMKV for storing preferences or session data.
Continue Screen Implementation (Owner: AI, Due: Ongoing): Proceed with implementing the UI and logic for other screens based on wireframes and user priority (e.g., Story Wizard, Library).
3. Open Questions
Is the app now visible and functioning correctly on your phone using the Expo Tunnel connection?
What specific area or screen would you like to focus on next after verifying the Onboarding screen loads? (e.g., Redux setup, Firebase config, Story Wizard UI, Library UI)?
4. Project Updates
Scope: No changes to the original project scope as defined in the provided Functional Specification.
Spec Changes: No modifications have been made to the Functional Specification document.
Development Progress:
Project initialized (kiddoscribe-app).
